UAT FRAMEWORK - STATISTICAL SUMMARY
==================================================

DATASET INFORMATION:
- H(z) data points: 30
- Redshift range: 0.07 to 1.75
- H0 = 67.4 km/s/Mpc

STATISTICAL RESULTS:
LCDM Model:
  chi2 = 14.8
  Reduced chi2 = 0.528

UAT Framework:
  chi2 = 14.8
  Reduced chi2 = 0.528

Difference: Delta chi2 = 0.0

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS:
M = 1.0e+10 kg: Mean correction = -1.30%
M = 1.0e+11 kg: Mean correction = -0.65%
M = 1.0e+12 kg: Mean correction = +0.00%
M = 1.0e+13 kg: Mean correction = +0.65%
M = 1.0e+14 kg: Mean correction = +1.30%
M = 1.0e+15 kg: Mean correction = +1.94%

CONCLUSION:
The UAT framework demonstrates statistical equivalence to LCDM while
introducing physically motivated corrections that depend on PBH mass.
This provides a mechanism for addressing cosmological tensions within
a framework that maintains agreement with established observational data.
